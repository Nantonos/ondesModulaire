ondesModulaire
==============

Eurorack analog synth implementation of ondes Martenot. This uses a
mixture of commercial and DIY modules. The controllers and the speakers
are all DIY. 

This repository documents the DIY modules that I am making specific to 
this project (as opposed to kits or designs made by others).

It will also document the controllers I am making (and the speakers, if 
I end up making any of those). They keyboard controller is started, partly working.
Documentation at http://nantonos.github.io/ondesModulaire/keyboard/docs/

Lastly, this repository houses resources (screenshots, recordings, notes) 
related to ongoing experiments to find the best emulation.

Planned state of the modules is available on Modular Grid and is updated
as experiments proceed:
http://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/30175
The actual current state is also available
http://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/61770
and is updated as modules are purchased, built, or designed and built, 
respectively.

A discussion thread on Muffs forum is the main place where this and related 
projects are discussed
