ondesModulaire
==============

Eurorack analog synth implementation of ondes Martenot. This uses a
mixture of commercial and DIY modules. The controllers and the speakers
are all DIY. See [the patch](Patch.md).

This repository documents the DIY modules that I am making specific to
this project (as opposed to kits or designs made by others).

- [Precision rectifier](precision%20rectifier/readme.md)
- [Dual Comparator](dual%20comparator/)
- [ondesMix](wavemix/)
- [Offsets](offsets/)

It is also documenting the controllers I am making, and the speakers.

The keyboard controller was started, was partly working, and was then
abandoned as the keybed was too heavy for the keyboard shake vibrato function.
The keys were also regular sized rather than the smaller OM style.

Lastly, this repository houses resources (screenshots, recordings, notes)
related to ongoing experiments to find the best emulation.

[Planned state of the modules](http://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/30175) is available on Modular Grid and is updated
as experiments proceed.

The [actual current state](http://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/61770) is also available and is updated as modules are purchased, built, or designed and built,
respectively.

A [discussion thread on Muffs forum](http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1261346) is the main place where this and related
projects are discussed
