Scope shots and spectra of attempts to emulate the ondes Martenot Creux waveform.

The spectra are scaled with 0dBFS at the top and -96dbFS at the bottom; frequencies
go from 20Hz to 20kHz although the FFT is unreliable much below 50Hz.

Triangle wave from the Intellijel Dixie 2 VCO being fed through a RYO Optodist LED limiter,
giving round-topped soft clipping. This works fairly well but could be a bit flatter on top
(more experimentation needed, is very sensitive to input level).

Optodist out was then fed to a highpass filter (A-106-5) with the cutoff below the 
fundamental, to phase shift the harmonics giving a tilted top to the wave. This did not 
work out well; the slope was too great and extraclipping is introduced. Need a cleaner filter
with more headroom.
