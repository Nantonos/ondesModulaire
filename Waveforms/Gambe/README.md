Scope shots and spectra of attempts to emulate the ondes Martenot Gambe (G) and Petit 
Gambe (g) waveforms.

The spectra are scaled with 0dBFS at the top and -96dbFS at the bottom; frequencies
go from 20Hz to 20kHz although the FFT is unreliable much below 50Hz.

Square wave from the Intellijel Dixie 2 VCO being fed through a highpass filter (A-106-5) 
with the cutoff below the fundamental, to phase shift the harmonics giving a tilted
top to the wave (G). This is then lowpass filtered (A-122) to remove higher harmonics
for the petit Gambe.

Results are moderately good for G (though with some hum and noise); more work needed
for g.
