Scope shots and spectra of attempts to emulate the ondes Martenot Octaviant (8) waveform, which is a sine wave folded to emphasise the second harmonic above the level of the fundamental.

The spectra are scaled with 0dBFS at the top and -96dbFS at the bottom; frequencies
go from 20Hz to 20kHz although the FFT is unreliable much below 50Hz.

Sine from the Intellijel Dixie 2 VCO fed into an Intellijel μFold waveshaper set to 
a single folding stage, verty small folding amount, with some offset so that only 
the top is folded.

Result (two attempts, the first (octish) adjusted while looking at the scope and the second
(octish2)  adjusted while looking at the spectra and maximizing second harmonic). Mmoderately 
good for octish2, although the fold is less sharp from the μFold than on the ondes Martenot.

Third attempt used a purer, filtered sine (A-122 lowpass) without noticeably better results.
