Scope shots and spectra of the sine output from Intellijel Dixie 2 VCO, filtered by
lowppass Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF) to remove higher harmonics.

The spectra are scaled with 0dBFS at the top and -96dbFS at the bottom; frequencies
go from 20Hz to 20kHz although the FFT is unreliable much below 50Hz.

Two filters are used here, the Doepfer A-105-6 12db/octave state variable filter 
(LM13700 based) and the Doepfer A-122 24db/octave lowpass (CEM 3320 based).

A-105-6 in low pass mode increases noise and saturation substantially, even with the input level at 
4 out of 10, and also picks up significant 50Hz mains hum. It is unsuitable for 
this application.

A-122 slightly increases 3rd harmonic and slightly rolls off from 15kHz onwards even 
when fully open, but is generally very clean at an input level of 5/10 and below. At minimum 
resonance and with medium levels of filtering (cuttoff 2 to 3 octaves above fundamental)
a substantially cleaned-up sine is produced with distortion mainly second and third harmonic.

Intellijel Î¼VCF 12dB/octave SVF (Coolaudio V2164 based) would be interesting to try for this application. It 
might be cleaner, but the 24db/octave of the A-122 probably makes it the better choice here.
