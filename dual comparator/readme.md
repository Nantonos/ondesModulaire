# Dual Comparator

This is a simple comparator circuit, which turns a triangle wave into a pulse wave with variable mark/space ratio.

I needed this because the Ondes Martenot has two pulse waveforms: Gambe and Nasillard. 
Gambe is roughly a pulse wave with 45% mark/space. (Petit gambe is a lowpass-filtered version of Gambe). 
Nasillard is another pulse, but with around 5% mark/space.

For convenience, there are two triwave inputs but input two is normalled to input one so that in the common case 
where two pulse waves are made from one triangle, only one connection is needed.

If a CV input is not connected, the front panel pots control the mark/space ratio.

Entirely unrelated (but convenient for this project) the grey knob provides an 
ultra-fine tuning control for a Dixie 2 or 2+. 

There are no jacks for this, use a 3-pin jumper cable to go from the internal 3-pin connector 
to the 3-pin ultrafine connector on the Dixie.
