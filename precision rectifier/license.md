This design is licensed with Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution Non-Commercial (cc-by-nc).

Attribution means say where it came from on any documentation, and preferably on the board.  Your choice on attribution on the panel. That includes the author names from the application note that the core circuit is from.

Non-commercial means private, hobbyist use is fine. I include short pcb or panel runs (like a group buy or trade on Muffs forum) as non-commercial, because the main motivsation there is passing on economy of scale savings to other synth DIY-ers. Obviously, building one and then selling it later is normal and expected and does not count as commercial.

If you want to do a large run, or sell as a kit or completed module on a profit basis, please contact me first.
