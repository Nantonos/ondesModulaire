# Ondes repertoire

Tell us a bit about your compositions/commissioning project for the ondes Martenot…
When I first started improvising on the instrument, I noticed how easy it was to dramatically change the sounds coming out of the instrument. This appealed to me greatly as a performer, but it also opened my eyes to compositional ideas. I then approached a number of friends who compose music, and gauged their interest in writing works for the instrument. In 2014 when I started playing the ondes in earnest, there was no Australian music for the instrument. Since then, I have written two works, Perth-based composer Jared Yapp has written a piece for ondes, percussion and strings, and Richard Mills wrote an ondes part for Victorian Opera’s 2017 production of ’Tis Pity, starring Meow Meow. I’m really excited at how quickly this has gained traction, and I hope the body of work for the instrument will grow exponentially over the coming years.
